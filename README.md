# Welcome
This repository was made as part of an MSc assignment at AgroParisTech, during which we attempted to calculate the carbon storage potential of agroforestry intensification in Morogoro region Tanzania. 

# Using the scripts
Open all scripts in an R-studio project. Set the working directory in Growth_Model.rmd and OAT_sensitivity_test.R. Run the Growth_model.rmd to check the model output for a single set of parameters.
Parameter values can be changed in Params.R. Run the OAT_sensitivity_test.R to see the effect of a 50% reduction/increase in each of the parameters on the final carbon storage. 

Enjoy!
